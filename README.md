# CrossTheWorld-GridBuilder

This is a builder that can be used to create grids for crosswords. It randomly generates crosswords.
You only have to get the builder, set the parameters you want and then build.

While studying how to generate grids, i noticed that there are two different types:
        -one kind has less intersections between the words (GridGeneratorEng)
        -the other kind has more "open spaces" where there are a lot of intersections (here in Italy we use this kind of grid)

    So i decided to create two different builder, one for each kind.

    Hope you will find this code useful and if you want you can help me improving it.

I also wrote a visual.html file. You cal use it to open the grids and see how they looks!
